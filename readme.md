# ESP32 Temperature and humidity controller

This is an Arduino code for a temperature and humidity controlling monitoring system using a DHT22 sensor and an LCD display.
The system can display the temperature and humidity readings on the LCD screen,
and the user can adjust the desired temperature setpoint through a menu interface.

## Getting Started

To get started with the ESP32 Temperature and humidity controller, you will need to install the PlatformIO IDE on VSCode.
Once you have installed the PlatformIO IDE, you can clone this repository and open the project in the IDE.
